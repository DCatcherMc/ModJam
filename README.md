ModJam
======
ModJam 2013 - Starting Friday 2nd August @ Midnight
            - Ending Tuesday 6th August @ Midnight
            
This is DCatcher's repo for ModJam


HOWTO Download:

Goto the Builds folder, and click the latest version. Then click VIEW RAW and it will download for you :)


Instructions on how to build:
===============================
Copy all files from forge/mcp/src/minecraft into a fully setup Minecraft Forge modding environment, 
(http://www.minecraftforge.net/wiki/Installation/Source)

and then start compile.bat in the folder OUTSIDE of the forge folder:

eg:




DCatcher ModJam
--------------------
| ---- forge
        
        |------ mcp
        
        |------ patches
        
        
        |------ (etc.)


|---- compile.bat

It should then compile the jar file, provided you have added java to your path variable and have a setup mcp environment :)

+ Every so often, I shall upload the latest built jar file, so you don't have to build it if you don't want to.

Test Commit pre-modjam :D

List of tameable mobs:
===========================
- Cow
- Sheep
- Creeper
- Spider
- Zombie
- Skeleton
- Endermen


Use the Mystic Saddle upon the mob, and then right click them (NOT HOLDING ANOTHER SADDLE) to ride them :)

Are the mobs not following your command?

Ask yourself one question.. how would YOU like it if someone came along and shoved a saddle on YOUR back/head.. They need to have a chance to realise what has happened and when they are comfortable, then they will move for themselves. After they have moved, then they should follow your every will!
(but if you really want to ride them. Then use a lead, and pull them slightly until they walk of their own accord. Now try :D)





How To actually play it.. for now :)
=======================================
1) Go into creative, and spawn some mobs, from the list on top

2) Spawn in a Mystic saddle

3) Click on the Tamed mob, and you can RIDE THEM!

(Slightly temperamental -> much like the vanilla piggies :))


TODO:
- Add more tamed mobs
- Add more stuff they can do ( fight for you perhaps??? >:D )
