ModJam
======
ModJam 2013 - Starting Friday 2nd August @ Midnight
            - Ending Tuesday 6th August @ Midnight
            
This is DCatcher's repo for ModJam


Instructions on how to build:
===============================
Copy all files from forge/mcp/src/minecraft into a fully setup Minecraft Forge modding environment, 
(http://www.minecraftforge.net/wiki/Installation/Source)

and then start compile.bat in the folder OUTSIDE of the forge folder:

eg:

DCatcher ModJam
--------------------
| ---- forge
        
        |------ mcp
        
        |------ patches
        
        
        |------ (etc.)


|---- compile.bat

It should then compile the jar file, provided you have added java to your path variable and have a setup mcp environment :)

+ Every hour I am modding, I shall upload the latest built jar file, so you don't have to build it if you don't want to.

Test Commit pre-modjam :D


How To actually play it.. for now :)
=======================================
1) Go into creative, and spawn some Replaced Cows/Sheep
2) Spawn in a MobRider(TM)
3) Click on the Replaced Cow/Sheep, and you can RIDE THEM!
(Slightly temperamental -> much like the vanilla piggies :))
