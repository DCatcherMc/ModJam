ModJam
======
ModJam 2013 - Starting Friday 2nd August @ Midnight
            - Ending Tuesday 6th August @ Midnight
            
This is DCatcher's repo for ModJam


Instructions on how to build:
===============================
Copy all files from forge/mcp/src/minecraft into a fully setup Minecraft Forge modding environment, 
(http://www.minecraftforge.net/wiki/Installation/Source)

and then start compile.bat in the folder OUTSIDE of the forge folder:

eg:




DCatcher ModJam
--------------------
| ---- forge
        
        |------ mcp
        
        |------ patches
        
        
        |------ (etc.)


|---- compile.bat

It should then compile the jar file, provided you have added java to your path variable and have a setup mcp environment :)

+ Every so often, I shall upload the latest built jar file, so you don't have to build it if you don't want to.

Test Commit pre-modjam :D



How To actually play it.. for now :)
=======================================
1) Go into creative, and spawn some Replaced Cows/Sheep

2) Spawn in a MobRider(TM)

3) Click on the Replaced Cow/Sheep, and you can RIDE THEM!

(Slightly temperamental -> much like the vanilla piggies :))

Are the mobs not following your command?

Ask yourself one question.. how would YOU like it if someone came along and shoved a saddle on YOUR back/head.. They need to have a chance to realise what has happened and when they are comfortable, then they will move for themselves. After they have moved, then they should follow your every will!
